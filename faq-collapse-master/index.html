          What are the benefits of incorporating your company in the Cayman
          Islands?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          There are no direct taxes in the Cayman Islands, meaning that there is
          no corporate, income, sales or capital gains tax. This allows
          companies to keep more of their profits by minimizing their tax burder
          to zero.

          What is the best type of company to incorporate in the Cayman Islands?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Regular companies that will operate in the Cayman Islands market and
          abroad should be set up as "Ordinary Resident Companies". Companies
          that don't serve the local Cayman market and only service foreign
          markets should be set up as "Exempt Companies".

          How much does it cost to set up a company in the Cayman Islands?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          It usually costs a couple thousand dollars in legal fees to
          incorporate a company in the Cayman Islands. It can be done for less
          if you don't outsource certain things to law firms, but most people
          don't have the expertise to do this, so they pay law firms to do it
          for them.
